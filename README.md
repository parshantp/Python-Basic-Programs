# Python-Basic-Programs
Introduction
The Python is most high-demanded programming language among other programming languages because it is simple as well as flexible to use, and easy to understand. This extensive collection of the libraries and the frameworks offers the perfect wide range of applications to come up with the web development and the scientific computing. The dynamism of Python is the focus of this article as we discuss several applications of it; here you will find programs that can be created with its help.

What is the Python Programming Language?
Unlike many other programming languages, Python is well known for its simplicity and readability due to having a high-level interpretation that makes it not complicated to understand. Developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and released to the public, Python ranks among the most sought-after programming languages today, alongside Shell Script, Java, C++, and Perl, used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

What is a Program?
A program, in the realm of programming languages of computer science and software development, is a definition of a set of instructions in a certain language which are given a task or tasked to resolve a particular problem. These guides are known as the code. They are written in a language, which a computer can follow in order to fulfil the result that we want.
